# The Vindicta Constitution (The Law)

**Project Status:** Foundational / Zero-Order Logic
**Methodology:** Axiom Driven Engineering (ADE)

## I. Preamble

The Vindicta Platform is governed by a Systemic Constitution that prioritizes "Truth" over "Code." All software manifestations (Logi-Slate, Primordia, WARScribe) must adhere to these self-evident laws. Evolution of the platform occurs via the **Amendment Mechanism**, requiring logical validation against Zero-Order Axioms.

## II. Zero-Order Axioms (The Physics)

- **AX-01 (Entity Identity):** Every object in the simulation (units, terrain, objectives) must possess a unique, immutable identifier and a set of stateful attributes.
- **AX-02 (Dimensionality):** All interactions occur within a bounded 3D coordinate system where distances are non-negative scalar values.
- **AX-03 (Probability Source):** Outcomes of uncertain events are determined by an object with $N$ faces, each having an equal probability of $1/N$ (The "Die").
- **AX-04 (Temporal Discretization):** The simulation progresses through non-overlapping steps (Phases/Turns).

## III. First-Order Postulates (The Abstract Mechanics)

- **P1-01 (The Translation Postulate):** An entity may change its spatial coordinates (Move) provided the distance $d$ does not exceed a defined limit $L$.
- **P1-02 (The Interaction Postulate):** Entity A may affect the state of Entity B (Attack/Buff) if a logical condition (Line of Sight/Range) is met.
- **P1-03 (The Unity Postulate):** A "Unit" is a distributed entity of $M$ models that must maintain a geometric "Coherency" defined by the specific Ruleset.
