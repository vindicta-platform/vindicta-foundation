# Meta Analysis

Discover what's winning and find your competitive edge.

---

## Overview

Meta Analysis helps you understand the competitive landscape — what armies are winning, which units overperform, and where the "sleeper" lists are hiding.

## Meta Dashboard

The Meta Dashboard shows:

- **Faction win rates** across all levels
- **Top performing lists** by event size
- **Trending units** (rising and falling)
- **Matchup matrices**

## Sleeper Detection

The Meta-Oracle AI identifies undervalued lists:

> "The 5-Agent Debate identifies lists that are **statistically underrepresented** relative to their win potential."

### How It Works

1. **Ingestion** — Tournament data is collected
2. **Analysis** — Win rates are calculated
3. **Debate** — AI agents argue for/against lists
4. **Ranking** — Sleepers are surfaced

```bash
vindicta oracle sleepers --faction "Tyranids"
```

## Unit Efficiency

See which units over/underperform:

- **Points efficiency** — VP generated per point
- **Survival rate** — Games where unit survives
- **Threat range** — Effective engagement distance
- **Kill efficiency** — Damage dealt per point
